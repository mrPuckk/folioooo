    input wire pixel_valid,
    output reg [7:0] pixel_out,
    output reg pixel_out_valid
);

    // Pipeline stages
    reg [7:0] stage1, stage2, stage3;
    reg valid1, valid2, valid3;
    
    always @(posedge clk or negedge rst_n) begin
        if (!rst_n) begin
            stage1 <= 8'h00;
            stage2 <= 8'h00;
            stage3 <= 8'h00;
            valid1 <= 1'b0;
            valid2 <= 1'b0;
            valid3 <= 1'b0;
        end else begin
            // Pipeline stage 1: Noise reduction
            stage1 <= noise_reduction(pixel_in);
            valid1 <= pixel_valid;
            
            // Pipeline stage 2: Edge detection
            stage2 <= edge_detection(stage1);
            valid2 <= valid1;
            
            // Pipeline stage 3: Filtering
            stage3 <= apply_filter(stage2);
