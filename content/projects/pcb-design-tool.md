# PCB Design Tool

## Project Overview

The PCB Design Tool is a comprehensive automation platform for printed circuit board design, featuring advanced routing algorithms, component placement optimization, and automated manufacturing file generation. This project streamlines the PCB design workflow from schematic capture to production-ready files.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

The system consists of:

- **Schematic Editor**: Interactive circuit diagram creation
- **Component Library**: Extensive database of electronic components
- **Auto-router**: Advanced routing algorithms for complex designs
- **Design Rule Checker**: Automated validation of design constraints
- **Manufacturing Interface**: Export to industry-standard formats

### Routing Algorithm

```python
class AutoRouter:
    def __init__(self, board, constraints):
        self.board = board
        self.constraints = constraints
        self.grid = RoutingGrid(board)
        
    def route_net(self, net):
        """Route a single net using A* algorithm"""
        start = net.start_point
        end = net.end_point
        
        # Initialize A* search
        open_set = PriorityQueue()
        open_set.put((0, start))
        came_from = {}
        g_score = {start: 0}
        f_score = {start: self.heuristic(start, end)}
        
        while not open_set.empty():
            current = open_set.get()[1]
            
            if current == end:
                return self.reconstruct_path(came_from, current)
                
            for neighbor in self.get_neighbors(current):
                tentative_g = g_score[current] + self.distance(current, neighbor)
                
                if neighbor not in g_score or tentative_g < g_score[neighbor]:
                    came_from[neighbor] = current
                    g_score[neighbor] = tentative_g
                    f_score[neighbor] = tentative_g + self.heuristic(neighbor, end)
                    
                    if neighbor not in [item[1] for item in open_set.queue]:
                        open_set.put((f_score[neighbor], neighbor))
